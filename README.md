Hello, I'm Arnaud 👋

I’m a Junior Full Stack Web Developer with a strong foundation in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and SQL, currently expanding my skills to build dynamic, user-friendly web applications. I recently completed an intensive Web Development Bootcamp with Le Wagon, where I had the opportunity to work on projects like an Airbnb clone and Second Spin Records, a platform for vinyl record enthusiasts.

My journey into tech is informed by a diverse background, from music industry management to hands-on experience in the hospitality industry, which has strengthened my adaptability, communication, and problem-solving skills. I’m excited to bring these experiences into the world of web development, where I aim to create meaningful digital solutions.

Second Spin Records: A platform for vinyl record collectors to showcase and exchange their collections.

Artbnb: A basic yet functional platform that mimics the core features of Airbnb, including user registration and booking.


🔧 Technologies & Tools I’m using:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Ruby on Rails
Database: SQL
Version Control: Git, GitHub
Deployment: Heroku
